Comment Bot &amp; Other Racing Stuff

* discord-comment.py
  - Comment bot for Discord. Doesn't fully work as of the initial commit. Crashes after completing the second loop. Some kind of a async issue, I'm not able to figure it out.
* local-comment.py  
  - Locally running comment script, prints to the screen.
* timing-scoring.py
  - Locally running T&S script, prints to the screen.
  - Formatting may occasionally be a bit of a mess in Windows/OSX/*nix depending on JSON data and how each OS handles tabs.
